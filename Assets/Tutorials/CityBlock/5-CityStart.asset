      Text:
        m_Untranslated: '1. In gameplay, your Main Camera must follow the player
          character while it moves on screen.


          2. A second camera should
          be added and configured to show a top-down map view of the city block.


          3.
          The second map camera should be positioned in a corner of the screen during
          gameplay.


          4. Add a third camera to provide a view of your choice.


          5.
          Add your third camera to another corner of the gameplay screen.


          Make
          sure your map and third camera views don''t obscure too much of your Main
          Camera view during gameplay.


          When you''re finished, save your
          scene and project file. Submit it to your teacher.


          Remember
          to complete all the tutorial questions for this lesson in the CodeHS editor.


          Select
          Done when you''ve finished.'
