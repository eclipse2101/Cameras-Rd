          frustum is known as a clipping plane. You can change the distance of each
          clipping plane to shorten or lengthen the view frustum.


          NOTE:
          To save on rendering everything in a game environment, which would dramatically
          slow down a game''s performance, you can use clipping planes to tell cameras
          how much of the game environment to render during gameplay.'

      Text:
        m_Untranslated: '1. Ensure the Main Camera GameObject is selected in the
          Hierarchy window.


          2. In the Inspector window, locate the Clipping
          Planes property.


          3. While watching the Main Camera viewer in
          the Scene editor, change the Near clipping plane from 0.3 to a value of
          6. How did this change what''s rendered?


          4. Change the Near
          clipping plane value back to 0.3.


          5. While watching the Main
          Camera viewer in the Scene editor, change the Far clipping plane from 100
          to a value of 10. How did this change what''s rendered?


          6.
          Change the Far clipping plane value back to 100.


          After experimenting
          with the Clipping Planes property, select the Next button to continue.'
